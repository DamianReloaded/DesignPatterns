/**
 * @brief
 * The Service Mesh design pattern is used to manage microservices communication in a more structured and controlled way.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Microservices Communication: Ensures communication between microservices in a consistent manner.
 * - Service Discovery: Automatically finds the location of services, making it easier to call them without hardcoding addresses.
 * - Load Balancing: Distributes requests across multiple service instances to improve performance and availability.
 * - Routing: Manages the flow of requests between services based on predefined policies.
 * - Security: Often includes authentication, authorization, and encryption for secure communication between services.
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Simplifies communication management: Centralizes the management of microservices communication.
 * - Enhances scalability and resilience: Manages communication at scale with built-in routing, load balancing, and service discovery.
 * - Improves security: Allows centralized handling of authentication and encryption.
 * - Reduces complexity for individual microservices: Services only need to communicate with the service mesh instead of directly managing complex interactions with other services.
